# Hybrid Vision Transformer (HybridViT) for Image Segmentation

The Hybrid Vision Transformer (HybridViT) combines the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers for image processing.

## Model Overview

HybridViT leverages both local and global image features. The model integrates overlapping patches, transformer-based encoding, and convolutional decoders for detailed feature extraction and spatial upscaling.

### Components

- **OverlappingPatchEmbed**: Converts input images into overlapping patches and embeds these patches into a higher-dimensional space, facilitating detailed initial feature extraction.
  
- **TransformerBlock**: Processes patch embeddings with normalization, multi-headed self-attention, and a feedforward network, learning complex patterns and relationships within the image.

- **TransformerEncoder**: Composed of several Transformer blocks, this encoder enhances the model's ability to capture intricate image patterns.

- **Decoder**: A series of transposed convolution layers designed to upscale the encoded features back to the original image resolution, enabling pixel-wise classification.

## Workflow for Segmentation

### Setup
1. **Image and Mask Preparation**: Preprocess images and segmentation masks from the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. Resize images to match the model input dimensions and adjust masks for pixel-wise classification.

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - **Patch Size and Stride**: Set to cover the image area effectively and allow overlapping for better feature integration.
   - **Embedding Dimensions**: Configured to capture diverse features from each patch.
   - **Number of Transformer Blocks**: Tailored to the complexity of the segmentation task.

### Training
1. **Patch Embedding**: Transform input images into overlapping patches that are then embedded.
2. **Class Token and Positional Embeddings**: Add these to maintain positional information and enhance overall image understanding.
3. **Encoder Processing**: Pass the sequence of embeddings through the transformer encoder to abstract and refine features.
4. **Decoder Upscaling**: Progressively upscale the encoded features to the full image dimensions for detailed segmentation outputs.

### Output
- The decoder output provides pixel-wise class predictions for each image, categorizing each pixel into a category (e.g., pet, background).

## Using HybridViT for Pet Image Segmentation
1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Images and masks are formatted and preprocessed to comply with the model's input requirements.
2. **Configure and Train the Model**: Setup the model with the appropriate configurations for the task and train it using the dataset.
3. **Evaluate and Optimize**: Post-training, assess the model's performance on a validation set and adjust parameters.
